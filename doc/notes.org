tokenioze also the text between entities, and also a couple of tokens on the left an right

- have a parmeter that controls the length of substrings
- explore different kinds of extraction such as

"is married to"
"is */VBZ to"

"is", "marries", "to" (1-grams)
n-grams
abstracted ngrams



Barack is married to Michelle.


The goal is to have a Rich Hybrid Representation i.e. combines syntactic and semantic info


- tokens between, to the left, to the right of the entities
-babelnet
- dbpedia
  + enrich the graph, but not too big
- uby

for FIM
- look also to some triples patterns, try to parameterize sub or obj not pred

Barack -> married to -> Michelle.

=>

X -> married to -> Michelle.

Barack -> married to -> X.

etc. and add them to the tweet.
